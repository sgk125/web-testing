                        <p class="margin-0 text-justify">Hybrid applications are gaining on the advantage of coding once and on running on twice the platforms. There have been multiple hybrid app platforms which were once popular once upon a time, such as Xamarin, the Microsoft backed hybrid app development platform was popular with financial and communication applications as it came with native UI and unmatched performance. But over time, the popularity has declined due to lack of updates and flexibility across platforms other than mobile application platforms. Many mobile application development platforms supported multiple operating systems such as Symbian and BlackberryOS as well, as the market for platforms other than iOS and Android operating systems have gone extinct.

                        <p class="margin-0 text-justify">There are only a couple of hybrid app development platforms which are competitive and technically competent enough to meet the expectations and demands of the clients as well as the end user.

                        <p class="margin-0 text-justify">Hybrid app development platforms have found a place among many companies whose services and products revolve around multiple digital platforms. In fact, around 70% of all mobile applications developed today are on Hybrid app development platforms. These application development platforms are open source and the active community is making more and more like a native app development platform in the sense of the word on a daily basis. At GIS Axiom, we have a team of hybrid application developers who with their experience and expertise create unique applications which cater the needs of the clients. We have designers and analysts who design and curate applications which also appeal to the end user as well.
